# POI-in-Enron-Company
Project Introduction
In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States.
By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. 
In the resulting Federal investigation, there was a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into public record,
including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives.
In this project, you will play detective, and put your new skills to use by building a person of interest identifier based on financial and
email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal.
To assist you in your detective work, we've combined this data with a hand-generated list of persons of interest in the fraud case, which 
means individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement, or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution 
immunity.
